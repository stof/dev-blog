We’re looking for a web developer with a preference for back-end development. Your time will be split between the maintenance of our existing (recent, no ancient legacy!) applications and the development of our new suite of next generation applications.

Areas of responsibility will depend on the skill and experience you add to the team, and there will be plenty of room to learn and explore new things.

We work mostly in PHP (Symfony2) but also believe in using the right tool for each particular job. Our stack also includes AWS, MySQL, ElasticSearch, Redis, and we use bits and pieces of things like Javascript (NodeJS) and Python for our tooling.

## What we need from you

- Experience developing complex applications with high-end MVC frameworks like Symfony.
- Familiar with good development practices (continuous integration, unit testing, etcetera) and Agile processes.

Naturally we would prefer you already have experience with our core stack, but you will also grab our attention if you can bring any of the following to the table:

- DevOps skills and experience with automated (cloud) deployment and provisioning.
- XBRL knowledge and/or experience with financial data in general.
- Microservices, distributed computing.
- Single Sign-On, OAuth, identity and authentication management in general.
- Designing RESTful API’s.

## What we offer

- Competitive salary
- Significant share based compensation
- Your own choice of tools (hardware, software)
- Budget for conferences, workshops, books etcetera
- Flexible working hours

Our software development team is located in our Amsterdam office. We strongly prefer EU citizens already located in or around Amsterdam. Only in exceptional cases will we consider relocation assistance and/or work permit sponsorship. No remote work.
